## Frontend interview project

As part of our application process, we would like you to complete this take-home assignment. It should take no more than a few hours.

### You have 2 options:
1. Create a new component that you would like us to see and discuss doing the interview.
2. Improve an existing component by modifying it

You can pick one of the options above.

### Task notes
- Consider current task more as a playground, feel free to add/adjust what you think will show off your skills and knowledge in a best way
- The provided components are not examples of complete or ideal components, therefore:
  1. They could be improved on
  2. They could be commented on. It would be also greate if comments question the way we do things or provide an alternative approach
  3. They could be a building block or an inspiration for creating a new custom component, feature
