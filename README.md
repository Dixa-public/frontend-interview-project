## Frontend Interview Project

As part of our application process, we would like you to complete this assignment. It should take no more than a few hours.

### You have 2 options:
1. Create a new component that you would like us to review and discuss doing the interview.
2. Improve an existing component by modifying it.

### Things to consider:
- Consider current task more as a playground, feel free to add/adjust what you think will show off your skills and knowledge in a best way.
- The provided components are not examples of complete or ideal components, therefore:
  - They could be improved on.
  - They could be commented on. It would be also great if comments question the way we do things or provide an alternative approach.
  - They could be a building block or an inspiration for creating a new custom component or feature.

- There is a [contribution guide](https://github.com/Dixa-public//frontend-interview-project/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) that we expect to be mostly followed (or questioned)

### Setting up the project:

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/Dixa-public/frontend-interview-project/generate) to create a **private repo** in your personal GitHub account.
2. Run `git clone git@github.com:{USERNAME}/frontend-interview-project.git` to clone the repo.
3. Open the project directory with `cd frontend-interview-project`.
4. Run `npm i` command to install the dependencies.
5. Run `npm run storybook` to start Storybook.

> DO NOT fork this template repository or create Pull Requests against it. [Use this template](https://github.com/Dixa-public/frontend-interview-project/generate) to create your own.

### Requirements:
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org)

### Project structure:
All of the components are placed in `src/components/` directory. And all of the storybooks are in `src/stories/`.

Currently `Icon` component internally uses free `font-awesome` icons. Please see the [list](https://fontawesome.com/icons?m=free) of expected `name` values.

### Contibuting guide:
See our [CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/Dixa-public/frontend-interview-project/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

### Submitting your solution:
When you are ready for us to look at your solution, do the following in **your repo**:

1. Create a Pull Request targeting the `master` branch. The solution must be implemented in a separate branch.
2. Add us as external contributors to your own private repo, so we can review your Pull Request.

When we are done, you, of course, own the code you made.
